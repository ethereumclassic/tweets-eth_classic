## Rules

On Twitter, `@eth_classic` was the Ethereum Classic community's verified account to which access was lost. With this renewed `@eth_classic` account, our aim is to empower the community to once again build a Twitter following and reputation that will allow for verified account status in the future. Community members submitting tweet suggestions to `@eth_classic` should take this into consideration. Suggested tweets should remain professional, relevant and neutral. 

In order to be approved, the contents of an `eth_classic` tweet must adhere to the following rules. If the tweet you wish to submit does not meet these restrictions, check out the [`@ETC_Network`](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/tweets-ETC_Network) Twitter account. While also a community account, `@ETC_Network` has a more relaxed set of rules for content and may allow memes and other forms of engagement driving content.

If you have suggestions to amend these rules, please create a new issue in this repository.

### Basics

All tweets must conform to the Twitter rules and policies found at https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies. Additionally;

- Dignity: No obscenities, explicit language, racism, sexism, etc.
- Neutrality: No attacking or promoting of non-ETC projects, no drama.
- Seriousness: No memes, jokes, quips, hot takes, etc.
- Accuracy: No linking to overly opinionated, biased or unverifiable information.
- Relevance: No spam, non-ETC related content, limit tweets about the same topic.
- Subtlety: Don't tell people to buy ETC directly, instead tell them *why*.
- Safety: No links to scams, no encouraging the purchase of assets.

### Content

The `@eth_classic` account serves to inform itâ€™s followers in an unbiased way about interesting happenings in the Ethereum Classic world. It is a pillar of neutrality, a honey badger that does not care about external drama, and serves to inform others about itâ€™s own situation, protocol updates, and other relevant news.

Tweets from this account should be written from the point of view of the ETC blockchain itself. If a proposed tweet cannot pass a test of "If it had a voice, would the chain itself say..." then that tweet would not be acceptable.

Acceptable topics to Tweet about include but are not limited to:

- Important development updates such as Hard Fork announcements.
- ETC philosophy and principles, their benefits, and quotes from the website.
- Benefits of ETC technical properties (such as PoW, Sound Money) compared to other blockchains (but must not â€˜dunkâ€™ on other projects).
- Keeping followers in the loop about important community discussions (e.g. ECIPs, ongoing debates).
- Community events, conferences, meetups, initiatives, discussions.
- Interesting technical analysis of network attributes such as hashrate, throughput, price movement.
- Ecosystem updates, new projects, wallets, services, exchange listings (see next below).

### Third Party Projects

- Must be relevant to ETC.
- Can be retweets, but must contain disclaimers (e.g. do your own research).
- **Large** projects from **established** teams that are well known to the crypto-Twitter community and have been operating for at least 2 years are allowed. E.g.
  - Binance listing USDT Tether tokens on the ETC blockchain
  - Chainlink deploys to ETC
  - Grayscale lists ETC ETF

### Retweets

- Retweeted content must follow the above rules, and/or include required disclaimer within retweet message.
- Must not excessively retweet the same account (up to 5 per month)

### Formatting and Style

- Neutral, factual writing style.
- Double spacing between new sentences.
- Correct use of capitalization.
- Reasonable use of Hashtags (up to 3 hashtags), e.g. #EthereumClassic, $ETC.
- Use of relevant images is encouraged (see Media style).
- Use of appropriate Emojis is encouraged.

### Review Process

For maintainers, during the review process; 

- **Do not trigger Actions from Pull Reqeusts that suspiciously modify the [workflow](/.github/workflows/twitter-together.yml) file**. Always check that the PR is only adding tweet or media files. Do not reopen a PR that has suspiciously modified the workflow file.
- Ensure that the generated preview is formatted correctly. The preview must be triggered manually if the submission comes from outside contributors.
- Maintainers should remain civil when discussing or reviewing submissions and should work towards creating the best tweets in the common interest.
- Either come to agreement in the PR about wording or appropriateness, or submit a new Pull Request.
- Do not edit original PR creatorâ€™s Tweet, other than to fix formatting or typos.
- Ensure that Pull Request Tweets adhere to the rules above. If it does, you can approve it:
